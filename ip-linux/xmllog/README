This is a packet logger with xml output for libip_udp. To use it, do
the following at the terminal where you want the packets to get logged
from and do:

$ export LOG_PACKETS=1

So to log all packets, you have to do this at both the server and the client.
Then start the logger, it will log to stdout:

$ ./xmllog

To stop the logger, you have to press control-D (End Of File) so that the
logger can write the closing tags before exiting.

The xml format makes it easy to transform the data with xsl-transformations.
An example transformation is given in the html/ dir, which transforms the
xml data to html.

The htmllog.sh script uses this transformation to produce html output just
like xmllog produces xml output.

$ ./htmllog.sh > html/log.html

Note that the html output needs the html/htmllog.css file to be in the same
directory.

Also note that the HTML stylesheet by default assumes that the two
addresses are 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.2 (ETH=1 and ETH=2). To use other
addresses, change the variables in htmllog.xsl.

BIG WARNING
-----------

We're not sure if the order of the logged packets is always right, therefore,
don't trust this tool too much.
